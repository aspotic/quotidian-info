\f0\fs24 \cf0 	This website is an ever increasing database of information about the art of drumming. As I have progressed through my years of drumming, there are a number of things I wish I had known to practice when I first started, and want to pass this info on to others.  This is not just a site for beginners however, since drumming is a continuous learning experience, I will continue to put up information.\
	Some of the information on here consists of grip types and analyses, sticking techniques, polyrhythms, genres, standard beats, etc.}
